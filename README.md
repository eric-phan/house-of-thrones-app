<h1 align="center">Houses of Thrones App</h1>
<h2 align="center">A fan-built Game of Thrones webapp to view your favorite House's sigil information</h3>



### :construction: This webapp is actively under construction! ###
#### Some Notes:
- This webapp was made using an [API] (https://github.com/eric-phan/gameofthones-api) I made.
- I want to maintain and add more of the lesser houses to the API when I can.
- I highly recommend watching the inital season of GoT or even thre prequel, House of the Dragon! Have fun!


#### Tech Stuff:
- This webapp was created and designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- I implemented a function that lets changes the background color of the app depending on your selection. Quite fun using my own API and making different outcomes depending on user input.


#### Future Improvements:
- I may add a random button to get your houses at the click of a button.
- Adding a dropdown list for the great houses to make for better UX.
- Make the code more concise with OOP.
