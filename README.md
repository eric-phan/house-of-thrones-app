<h2 align="center">A fan-built pokemon webapp to view your favorite pokemon's shiny versions.</h3>



### :construction: This webapp is actively under construction! ###
#### Some Notes:
- This webapp was made using PokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co/ 
- The webapp supports the 900+ pokemon featured in the main series games.


#### Tech Stuff:
- This webapp was created and designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- I used Math.random() along with some CSS to create a sleek 'Feelin' Lucky?' button: you can generate random Pokemon with this!


#### Future Improvements:
- I may tweak the CSS in the future to make the site more interactive, but the minimalist design does the job for now.
- Adding an algorithm to change the color of the site to match the Pokemon's type.
- As I progress with JS, I can go back to this webapp and add more OOP-based coding to its algorithms.
